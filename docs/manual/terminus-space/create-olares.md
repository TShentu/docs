# Create a cloud-based Olares

Cloud-based Olares offer a convenient deployment option, enabling you to set up a Olares environment without managing hardware directly.
This section provides a step-by-step guide to creating and managing your cloud-based **Olares**. 

::: tip NOTE
- The **Host Service** is currently in an invite-only beta phase. To access the cloud-based Terminus, contact us for an invitation.
- If you are looking for information about setting up a Self-Hosted Terminus, please refer to the [Getting Started Guide](../get-started/index.md).
:::

## Prerequisites

Ensure you get an Orales ID to log in to Orales Space and activate the Orales instance.

## Create an Olares

1. Log in to [Orales Space](https://space.jointerminus.com/) by scanning the QR code using **LarePass**.
2. Navigate to the **Cluster** page and select the second option to start creating.

3. Configure the environment for installation as below:
   - **Select Cloud Provider**: Choose a cloud service provider and the data center location closest to your users or workloads.
   - **Hardware Configuration**: Select the instance's CPU, RAM, and storage resources.
   - **Olares Version & Kubernetes Setup**: Choose the appropriate version of Terminus and the Kubernetes/K3S solution to be installed.

    :::tip
    If you intend to host large language models (LLMs), select the **Alibaba Cloud Hong Kong** region. Currently it is the only region that offers instances with shared GPU services.

4. Review our fees for storage and traffic.

    ::: tip NOTE
    Each instance comes with a set amount of free storage and bandwidth. If your usage exceeds these quotas, additional fees will apply based on your cloud providerâ€™s pricing. 
    :::
5. Review your order details, including instance configuration, selected options, and fees.
6. Complete the payment to initiate the installation process.

## Monitor installation

The creation and installation of your cloud-based Terminus typically take around **10 minutes**. During this time, you can monitor the progress and logs in real-time.

### System statuses

The installation follows several key stages, represented by different statuses:

| Status             | Description                                                   |

### Real-time logs

Click on **Log** to view detailed logs and monitor the installation process in real time.

## Activate Orales  

When the installation enters the **Pending Activation** state, activate Orales as described below:

1. Click the **Activation** button. A pop-up window will display the **Orales ID**, **one-time password**, and a **Wizard URL**.
