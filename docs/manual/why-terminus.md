# Why Terminus

In today's digital world, we're facing significant challenges that Terminus aims to address:

- Data ownership: Large tech companies often control and profit from user data, compromising individual privacy and digital rights.
- Technological inequality: Advanced technologies, particularly in AI, have been primarily accessible to large corporations, creating a digital divide.
- Privacy concerns: The rapid advancement of AI has intensified worries about data privacy and sovereignty, issues that traditional platforms struggle to address adequately.

Trying to take control of your digital life feels like solving a Rubik's cube blindfolded. It's time for a simpler solution.

## Why use Terminus

With the mission to "let people own their data gain", the core benefits of Terminus mainly are:

* Data ownership and privacy
* Decentralized and self-hosted infrastructure
* Democratization of advanced technologies

### Data ownership and privacy
**How does Terminus ensure users maintain control over their data?**

Terminus empowers users to truly own and control their information by providing a self-hosted operating system. By running on user-owned edge devices, Terminus ensures that personal data remains under the user's control, rather than being stored on third-party servers. This approach significantly enhances privacy and data security, allowing users to break free from the data policies of large tech companies.

### Decentralized and self-hosted infrastructure
**How does Terminus provide a decentralized alternative to traditional cloud services?**

Terminus converts edge devices into powerful home clouds, offering cloud-level capabilities while maintaining ease of use and privacy. The system is built on Kubernetes, providing a robust and scalable foundation for running applications and services. This architecture allows users to host and manage their own services, from file storage to social media applications, without relying on centralized platforms.

### Democratization of advanced technologies
**How does Terminus make advanced technologies accessible to individual users?**

Terminus is dedicated to advancing technological and AI equality by making capabilities previously accessible only to large companies available to every user. The system is future-proof and AI-ready, allowing users to explore AI capabilities locally. Additionally, Terminus provides an extensive, permissionless application ecosystem with nearly 100 free applications covering a wide range of needs, from productivity to entertainment. This democratization of technology enables individual users to leverage powerful tools and services that were once the domain of large organizations.
