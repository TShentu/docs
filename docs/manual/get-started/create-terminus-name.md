# Create Terminus Name

A Terminus Name is a unique identifier within the Terminus ecosystem, serving as your digital identity and gateway to various services and features.

A Terminus Name consists of a local name and a domain. For example, in `alice123@myterminus.com`:
- `alice123`: Local name
- `myterminus.com`: Domain name

## Download and install TermiPass app

To get started with Terminus, you'll need to download TermiPass on your mobile device. TermiPass is available for both Android and iOS platforms:

* For Android users: Install TermiPass from the Google Play Store.
* For iOS users: Download TermiPass from the App Store.

## Create a Terminus Name

Depending on your personal preference, choose how to create a Terminus Name:
- Create without VC (default): Recommended for individual users who prefer a quick setup without binding a verification credential (VC).
- Create with VC: Recommended for individual and organizational users that require enhanced security and more distinctive names through VC binding.
