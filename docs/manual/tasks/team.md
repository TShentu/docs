# Start a team
Do you want to share Terminus with your family, friends, or coworkers? Here's everything you need to know about creating a collaborative Terminus environment.

## Why Terminus for teams
Terminus's multi-user design efficiently shares system resources, eliminating redundant deployments that would otherwise increase with each new user.
 
When you share Terminus with others, you can:
* Create a powerful workspace using professional-grade open source alternatives without subscription fees.
* Enable everyone to access resource-intensive AI applications without system overhead.
* Build a central hub for shared files, photos, and documents with secure access from anywhere.
* Store and manage shared files, photos, and documents.

Transform your system into the hub that best serves your group - a smart home control center, a workspace, or a media server. With the rich applications in Terminus, you can customize the environment to match how your team wants to work and collaborate.

## The Terminus cluster
Your Terminus installation creates a Kubernetes-based environment that efficiently supports multiple users while minimizing system overhead. Think of your Terminus installation as a digital home for your team. When you set it up, your device becomes a private server that everyone can access securely.

## Your role as administrator
As a Terminus administrator, you'll mainly be responsible for:

* Managing user accounts for team members
* Installing and maintaining system-wide applications that everyone shares
* Ensuring fair resource allocation across the system
