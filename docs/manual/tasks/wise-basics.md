### Track your reading progress
Wise uses green dot indicators on article covers to help you track unread content. When you open an article, it's automatically marked as read.

While reading, you can manually toggle between **<i class="material-symbols-outlined">playlist_add_check</i>Seen** or **<i class="material-symbols-outlined">playlist_remove</i>Unseen** status in the toolbar to maintain your reading progress.
