# What is Olares

Olares is a open-source self-hosted solution that enables users to convert their personal edge devices into sovereign clouds, offering a powerful alternative to traditional public cloud services. Built on Kubernetes, Olares deliver cloud-level capabilities while ensuring user privacy and ease of use.

## BEC architecture 

Olares introduces a next-generation decentralized Internet framework through its Blockchain-Edge-Client (BEC) architecture. BEC decentralizes data storage and enhances security by distributing information across suitable platforms.

- **Edge**: The decentralized web node for users, hosting personal data such as documents, chat logs, and photos on private edge servers. Data remains within the userâ€™s control on the edge, ensuring privacy and local data sovereignty. 
- **Blockchain**: Storage of high-value data, including decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and transactions on the blockchain via smart contracts. This enables transparency, immutability, and enhanced discoverability of data.
- **Client**: The identity wallet app that ensures users can securely manage their identities and interact with their self-hosted systems while maintaining ownership and privacy over their digital credentials.

## Core components of Olares

Corresponding to the BEC architecture, Olares comprises the following core components:

- [**Snowinning Protocol**](https://docs.snowinning.com/protocol/overview.html): A decentralized identity and reputation system that integrates decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), and reputation data. It enhances trust by enabling transparent and verifiable interactions within decentralized environments.
- [**Olares OS**](https://github.com/beclab/Olares): A comprehensive, self-hosted operating system designed for edge devices. It allows users to host and manage their own data and applications, transforming personal edge devices into robust, sovereign cloud systems.
- **LarePass**: A secure, unified interface software that connects users to their Olares systems. It offers key functionalities, including identity management, remote access, device management, and data storage, ensuring seamless interactions with Olares.
