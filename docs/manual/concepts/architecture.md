# Architectural components

Olares provides a next-generation decentralized Internet framework based on a 
Blockchain-Edge-Client (BEC) architecture and a few protocols.

## BEC architecture

The BEC architecture comprises the following components:

- [**Snowinning protocol**](https://docs.snowinning.com/protocol/overview.html): A decentralized identity and credit system which provides a framework for secure, trustless exchanges of information and value. It integrates decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), and reputation data.
- [**Olares**](https://github.com/beclab/Olares): A cloud-native, self-hosted operating system based on Kubernetes. It transforms your home edge device into a personal cloud, giving you complete control over your data and applications.
- [**LarePass**](https://www.olares.xyz/larepass): A comprehensive client software that securely bridges users to their Olares systems. It offers remote access, identity and device management, data storage, and productivity tools, providing a seamless interface for all Olares interactions.

##  Protocols

Olares is a protocol-based platform. In addition to the Snowinning Protocol, there are three protocols that back the Olares ecosystem:

- **Otmoic protocol**: A protocol based on Request For Quote (RFQ) and on-chain reputation to provide prices and exchange values for public goods. It's built for Depin, AI Agent, and Crypto Trading that does not require third-party trust.
- **Market protocol**: A permissionless app distribution protocol that eliminates the need for stringent reviews and commissions by intermediaries like Apple.
- **Recommend protocol**: A decentralized and privacy-protecting information distribution protocol designed to free you from the information bubble.
