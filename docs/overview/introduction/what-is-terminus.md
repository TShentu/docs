# What is Terminus?

Terminus's mission is to "let people own their data again".

It provides a next-generation decentralized Internet framework based on the Blockchain-Edge-Client [(BEC)](./bec.md) architecture, consisting of three core components and a series of protocols.

**Core components**:

- [Snowinning Protocol](../snowinning/overview.md), an identity and reputation protocol that complies with W3C standards. It is owned by users, and is based on blockchain smart contracts.
- [Terminus OS](../terminus/overview.md), a source-available cloud-native operating system based on Kubernetes improvements that runs on user-owned edge devices.
- [TermiPass](../../how-to/termipass/overview.md), a client software that helps users manage on-chain identities and edge devices.

**Protocols:**

We believe that in the future decentralized world, platforms may no longer exist but protocols will remain forever. In addition to Snowinning Protocol, we also provide three protocol prototypes:

- [Otmoic Protocol](../protocol/otmoic.md), a protocol based on Request For Quote (RFQ) and on-chain reputation to provide prices and exchange values for public goods.
- [Market Protocol](../protocol/market.md), a permissionless app distribution agreement, in the new world, no more stringent review and commission extracted by middlemen like Apple.
- [Recommend Protocol](../protocol/recommend.md), a decentralized and privacy-protecting information distribution protocol, aiming to pulling you out of the information cocoon.

We look forward to find more like-minded partners and create more agreements. Allow people to regain their digital sovereignty.

Terminus derives its name from the book "Foundation" by Asimov. It is a planet at the end of the galaxy, where scientists compile the "Encyclopedia", hoping to record all the knowledge of all mankind over the past thousand years. This is in line with our vision:

> _Every person, every family and every business will be able to record their unique journey through their own Terminus in the future._

## Use Cases

- **Self-Hosted**

  We aim to make Terminus a one-stop self-hosted solution.

  In the past 2 years, we have drawn inspiration from [`/r/SelfHosted/`](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/). Terminus is the result of this inspiration, and we are excited to present and share it with you.

- **Local AI**

  Today when people are increasingly concerned about privacy, the [AI Framework](../terminus/ai.md) provided by Terminus helps users build Agents locally with no code writing required.

  Through integration with local data and applications, we hope that Terminus can become the second brain of users in the future.

- **Decentralized Social Media**

  Users can install Mastodon, Ghost, WordPress and other applications on Terminus with one click to build their personal brand and interact directly with other users without worrying about being banned by the platform or receiving commissions from the platform.

- **DePin**

  Terminus provides comprehensive management of the cluster from computing, storage to networking. And projects can develop mining programs on Terminus. Users can share idle physical resources with the entire network and get paid.

  Although it is difficult to find an effective proof of work in the physical world, we firmly believe that through the combination of [Snowinning Protocol](../snowinning/overview.md) and [Otmoic Protocol](../protocol/otmoic.md), it will become a DePin network that users use daily.
