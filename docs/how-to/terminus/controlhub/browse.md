## Namespace

In the **'Browse'** page, the first column is the `Namespace`. It categorizes different `Namespaces` into **user** and **system** projects.

- **User projects**:<br>
  include each user's independent namespace. Namespaces prefixed with `user-space` are built-in applications for users. Those prefixed with `user-system` are user-related system programs or components, typically TAPR components, scheduling and proxy programs for cross-application interaction within a user's applications.

- **System projects**:<br>
  include the foundational programs of the Terminus OS system cluster, along with system-level service programs. For instance, within `os-system`, there's a **Middleware** database that serves the entire cluster, a system-level **Vault**, and a cluster-wide SSO service **Authelia**.

:::tip
Member can only see projects under their own `User projects`, while admin can see projects under `System projects` as well as projects under all user's namespaces.

## Project Resources

Clicking on a `Namespace` expands the middle column that contains all resource types within that `Namespace`. These resources include `Workload`, `Service`, `ConfigMap`, `Secret`, and `ServiceAccount` for applications.

Clicking on any resource will show its detailed information in the third column. The details may vary depending on the type of resource.

## Workloads

`Workloads` are units of applications running on Terminus OS. This view is the most commonly used in Terminus OS and corresponds to **three** forms of resources in **Kubernetes**:

- **Deployment**<br>
  A deployment is the most commonly used form of workload in **Kubernetes**. It automatically generates a ReplicaSet to schedule and generate Pods, creating more Pod replicas for horizontal scaling.

- **StatefulSet**<br>
  A stateful set is typically used to deploy `stateful` Pods, such as Pods for databases, distributed file storage, or in-memory caching. With **StatefulSet**, each Pod may hold different data, resulting in Pods with different states. Therefore, **StatefulSet** often schedules Pods in a sequential manner.

- **DaemonSet**<br>
  A daemon set is different from the other two. It schedules and runs only one Pod on each node. In other words, the number of Pods generated by a daemon set is usually equal to the number of nodes. Therefore, **DaemonSet** is also used for node-specific hardware operations.

### View Resource Details
![alt text](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/02.jpg)

Opening the details view of a deployment, the content is as follows:

- #### Details
  Basic information about the workload, including the **number of replicas**, **name of Namespace**, **creation time**, etc.

- #### Pods
  This section contains information about the Pods scheduled by the workload. It shows the Pod's name, running status, the name of the node it is running on, its IP address, and recent CPU and memory monitoring charts.

  You can click the **Revision Records** button in the top right corner to view the differences in Pods' scheduling history. You can manually refresh the Pods' status by clicking the refresh button.

  ![revision records](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/03.jpg)

  Clicking on the name of a Pod takes you to the Pod's details page.

  ![containers](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/04.jpg)
  - **Details**<br>
    Contains basic information about the Pod, including **Namespace, running status, restart count, IP address, creation time**, etc.

  - **Containers**<br>
    A list of containers within the Pod. Each entry in the list displays the container's **name, running status, exposed external ports,** and recent **CPU and memory monitoring charts**. The container list includes both the initialization containers and the running containers in the workload.

    The two buttons next to the container name allow you to **view the container's logs** and **open a terminal environment** inside the container to examine its contents.

    The four operation buttons in the top right corner of the container log are: enter **real-time update** status of the log, **refresh** the latest log, **download** the log, and **open log in new window**.

    ![container log](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/05.jpg)

    :::tip
    You can only view the logs of containers within your own Namespace and open the terminal environment of the container.
    :::

  - **Volumes**<br>
    This section displays a list of persistent volumes configured for the Pod. Each entry includes the volume's name, its corresponding **PersistentVolumeClaim**, and the associated local path.

    ![pod volumes](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/06-1.jpg)

  - **EnvironmentVariables**<br>
    This section displays the environment variables defined for the Pod. Each variable entry shows the name and value of the variable.

    ![workload env](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/06-2.jpg)

  - **Events**<br>
    This section shows the events related to the Pod. If there are any issues scheduling the pod, you can check here.

- #### Ports

  The ports list shows all the exposed port collections of the containers in the workload's pod. The content includes their **names, protocol types, and port numbers**.

- #### Environment variables

  Below the Ports, you'll find the **environment variables** defined by the `workload` in pod template, which is similar to the content in the pod details.

- #### Labels

  **Labels** are configured in the `workload` metadata. These **Labels** are usually status labels used for coordination by various `controller programs` in Terminus OS.

  Another important use of **Labels** is the management of **Kubernetes**. **Labels** are often used as indices for filtering and matching. The blue background is the **Key** of the label, followed by the **Value** of this label.

  ![workload labels](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/07.jpg)

- #### Annotations
  
  The **Annotations** of a `workload` are located under the **Labels**. Similar to **Labels**, **Annotations** serve as a tool for `controllers` to manage `workloads`.

  **Annotations** are more flexible in terms of value field length and character range. However, unlike **Labels**, **Annotations** do not have the filtering and matching function

- #### Events
  The last section is **Events**. Much like the **Events** in **Pod details**, you can view the latest events related to the `workload` here. The content usually shows the scheduling status of the Pod.
  
  There's a refresh button in the upper right corner of this section. You can click to get the latest **Events**.

  ![workload events](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/08.jpg)

  :::tip
  **Kubernetes** only retains **Events** within 1 hour by default, which means you can find **Events** within 1 hour here.
  :::

### Modify Running State

In the resouce details page, you can find the number of Pod replicas at top. On the right of replicas, there are `+` and `-` buttons. You can use these to change the number of Pod replicas.


![replicas](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/09.jpg)

:::warning
Many applications in Terminus OS do not support multi-replica mode. If you increase the number of replicas for these Pods, it may cause exceptions. Therefore, it's important to read the documentation thoroughly and adjust the number of replicas with caution.
:::

### Edit YAML

In the upper right corner of the resource details page, you'll find a **'...'** icon. Click it to expand a drop-down menu. Select **'Edit Yaml'** to view the resource configuration details, presented in yaml format. In the pop-up text editing dialog, you can modify the yaml configuration of the current `workload`. Click **'OK'** to save your changes and apply them.

![edit yaml](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/10.jpg)

## Secrets

**Secrets** are used to store an application's sensitive data, such as **passwords, credentials, and key configurations**. In **Kubernetes**, this data is stored in a non-plaintext format and is `Base64` encoded by default.

![secrets](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/11.jpg)

After expanding the second column on the **Secrets** section, you can view all **Secrets** under the application's `Namespace`. Click to access the Secret's **Details** and **Data** in the details page.
- **Details**: This displays the Secret's basic information, including the `Namespace` it belongs to and the creation time.
- **Data**: This section displays the **Data Key** and **Data Value** of the **Secret**.

::: tip
The **Data Value** shown by default is the `Base64` encoded. You can click the **preview** button at the top right of this section to see the original text.
:::

## ConfigMap

**ConfigMap** has a structure similar to **Secrets**. However, the content stored in the **ConfigMap** is saved in plaintext.

![configmaps](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/12.jpg)

Likewise, you can expand the second column on the **ConfigMaps** section to view all the **ConfigMaps** under the application's `Namespace`. Click to access the ConfigMaps's **Details** and **Data** in the details page.
- **Details**: This displays the basic information of the **ConfigMap**, including the `Namespace` it belongs to, creation time, etc.
- **Data**: This section displays the **Data Key** and **Data Value** of the **ConfigMap**.

## Service Account

The **Service Account** is a mechanism that **Kubernetes** uses to authenticate cluster container applications, allowing them to access resources managed by **Kubernetes**. The **Kubernetes** client program within the application can create a client and access the **Kubernetes API** using the configuration injected by the **Service Account**. **Kubernetes** then authorizes the request based on the role bound with the **Service Account**.

Each **Service Account** is linked to a **Secret**. This **Secret** includes the **Service Account's** `CA certificate`, `Namespace`, and `Token`.

![Service accounts](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/13.jpg)

You can expand the second column on the **Service Accounts** section to view all the **Service Accounts** under the application's `Namespace`. Click to access the Service Accounts's **Details**, **Data** and **Kubeconfig Settings** in the details page.
- **Details**: This displays the basic information of the **Service Account**, including the `Namespace` it belongs to, creation time, etc.
- **Data**: This section displays the **Data Key** and **Data Value** of the **Secret** linked to this **Service Account**.
- **Kubeconfig Settings**:<br>
  It is the kubeconfig configuration automatically generated by this **Service Account**. Developers can download this configuration and incorporate it into an application within the container. Alternatively, an application in the container can read the **Service Account configuration** injected by **Kubernetes** at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/`.


## Services

**Service** is a method in **Kubernetes** that exposes network applications running on a single or a group of Pods as network services. The group of Pods associated with the Service is typically determined by a defined `Selector`.

A `Selector` is usually a combination of **Labels**. Based on the selection expressions, it can filter out one or more Pods from the Pod resources. Therefore, in a sense, Service is a `virtual IP(VIP)` service. It distributes traffic requests to a single Pod or a group of Pods through a `VIP`, according to the `Selector`.

![service1](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/14.jpg)

You can expand the second column of the page `Services` to view all the `Services` under the Namespace of this application. Click to see the Details, Workloads, Ports, Pods, Labels, Annotations, and Events of this `Services` in the details column.

You can expand the second column on the **Service** section to view all the **Service** under the application's `Namespace`. Click to see **Details, Workloads, Ports, Pods, Labels, Annotations,** and **Events** of this **Services** in the details page.
- **Details**:<br>
  Displays the basic information of the **Service**, including the `Namespace` it belongs to, **creation time, selector, virtual IP, type,** and the address of this service in the cluster **DNS**, etc.

- **Workloads**:<br>
  This is the list of Workloads selected by the **Service's** selector.It displays the workload's name and status, etc.

- **Ports**:<br>
  Displays the Ports list exposed by this Service. The content includes the port number of each Port, the protocol it allows, and the port number of the upstream destination.

- **Pods**:<br>
  This is the list of Pods selected by the **Service's** selector. The content includes the Pod's name, node, IP address, and the recent CPU, memory monitoring charts.

  From this list, you can see where the **Service's** traffic is directed clearly. If the list is empty, it indicates that there may be an exception with this **Service**.


- **Labels**:<br>
  Displays the **Labels** of the **Service**

- **Annotations**:<br>
  Displays the **Annotations** information of this **Service**

- **Events**:<br>
