You can use the **Vault** in **TermiPass** to store passwords and utilize the autofill feature on the **TermiPass** mobile client.

For other **Vault** features, please refer to the [Vault help documentation](../terminus/vault/index.md).

## Android Password Autofill

### Enable Service

First, you need to enable the autofill service in the **'Settings'**. Open **TermiPass**, switch to the **Setting** tab, then turn on **'Autofill'** toggle.

### Autosave

Once enabled, **TermiPass** will prompt you to save your username and password when you enter them in an app.

- Press **'confirm'** to automatically save the credentials to the **Vault**.
- Press **'cancel'** to skip this Autosave.

### Autofill

If you have saved the username and password for an app, a **TermiPass** dialog will appear when you click on the username or password box during your next login. Unlock the TermiPass to select the username and password from the Vault list. Then, when you switch back to the app interface, you'll see that the username and password fields have been filled.

## iOS Password Autofill

Due to system restrictions on iOS, TermiPass cannot implement the password autosave and autofill feature like it does on Android. The process is slightly different on iOS.

### Launch TermiPass Interface

You can store your username and password in **TermiPass** using the system keyboard. When you need to enter your credentials in any app, a key icon will appear at the top of the keyboard. Click on it, and you will see **TermiPass** in the list. Select **TermiPass** and unlock it to add the username and password into the Vault manually.

Alternatively, you can open **TermiPass** directly and save your username and password to the Vault at any time.

### Autofill

You can use **TermiPass** to autofill your username and password in a similar way using the keyboard. Simply select and unlock **TermiPass**, then choose an **Vaults Item** that contains your login credentials. This will automatically fill the related fields in the app.
