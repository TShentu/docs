![alt text](/images/how-to/termipass/termipass.jpg)

**TermiPass** is a client that helps you manage [DID](../../overview/snowinning/concepts.md#decentralized-identifier), [Terminus Name](../../overview/snowinning/terminus-name.md), and [Terminus](../../overview/terminus/overview.md) devices. **TermiPass** is the bridge between you and your **Terminus**, enabling a seamless connection to your **Terminus**, anytime and anywhere.

**TermiPass** is a user-friendly software packed with lots of features. It not only meets the common need for **storing and accessing** documents, photos, and videos, but also serves as a **workflow software**, helping you get things done more efficiently. In contrast to traditional workflow software that runs third-party apps on different servers, TermiPass allows both the system and the associated apps to run on your server.

We will continue to enhance **Termipass** with new features in this direction. Upcoming functions include **chat**, **calendar**, and **document**.
