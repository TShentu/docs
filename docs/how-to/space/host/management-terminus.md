# Management Terminus

## View Panel Data

To view system data through **Terminus Space**, log into **Terminus Space** via the **'Settings'** application on **Terminus**. This action will authorize you to access your system data, providing insight into storage usage and traffic consumption.

You can view [Integration](../../terminus/settings/integration.md) for more information.

If you're using **Self-Hosted Terminus**, you need to pay attention to the traffic data for **intranet penetration** and the **storage usage** by backup services. This is because if you are using these services, you may be charged based on usage.

## Add Worker

If you are using Terminus in the cloud, you can add **Worker Nodes**.

Click the **'...'** more button in the upper right corner, select **'Add Worker'**, and in the following guide page, choose the hardware configuration and review fees for storage and traffic. Confirm the order and submit it.

## Return Terminus

If you no longer need your Terminus services in the cloud, you can return Terminus.

Click the **'...'** more button in the upper right corner, select **'Destroy Terminus'**. Confirm the action and your current usage will be **immediately settled**. If a refund is due, the funds will be quickly returned to your account balance. If an additional payment is required, please confirm and settle the payment.

## Shared GPU

We currently do not provide instances that include GPUs. If you have such a need, please get in touch with us.

We offer individual users a shared GPU solution based on rCuda. This solution is effective for applications like Stable Diffusion and costs approximately $0.02 per image. However, it still needs further enhancements for Large Language Models (LLM)
