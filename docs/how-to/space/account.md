## Log In

We use **Decentralized ID (DID)** as the method for logging in. This guarantees that the user maintains control over their identity and data ownership.

:::info
Terminus Name is your identifier in the world of Terminus. Learn more about [what is Terminus Name](../../overview/snowinning/terminus-name.md).
:::

Please obtain your **DID/Terminus Name** using the **TermiPass** client and scan the QR code to log into **Terminus Space**.

The screenshots above show three places on **TermiPass** where you can scan the QR code to log into **Terminus Space**:

- The result page displayed after creating your **DID**
- The landing page after you've bound your **Terminus Name**
- The **Settings** page that appears after successfully activating your **Terminus**

For more information about your account, you can refer to the [account details](../termipass/account/index.md).

## Account Type

You can log into **Terminus Space** using either a **DID** or a **Terminus Name**. However, the features and services available on **Terminus Space** will vary based on the `account type`.

- **DID**: <br>
  When you log in with this account type, you cannot create a **Terminus** until you bind a **Terminus Name**. However, you have the option to set your own domain because no domain has been bound yet.


- **Terminus Name**:<br>
When you log in with this account type, you should be able to create a **Terminus**, unless your **Terminus Name** is already bound to another **Terminus**. However, you will not be able to set your own domain, as the **Terminus Name** is already connected to a domain.

## Multi-account Management

Each **Terminus Name** can be bound to just one **Terminus**. With **Multi-account Management** in **Terminus Space**, you can easily switch between accounts. This is handy if you own multiple **Terminus Names** and **Terminuses**.

To add an account, click the avatar in the top-right and select **'Import Account'** from the pop-up menu. You will be directed back to the QR code page to scan and log in.

Once you've added several accounts, you can change between them using the **'Switch Account'** option in the pop-up menu. If the account you're switching to is logged out, you'll be redirected to the QR code login page.

## Log Out

Click your avatar in the top-right corner and then click **'Log Out'** to log out your account.

Or, choose **'Switch Account'** from the menu, then press the **Exit Icon** next to any listed account.

:::tip
Logging out will only clear this account's login records in this browser; it won't change any account data.
