# Terminus Space

## Introduction

[Terminus Space](https://space.jointerminus.com/) has two key features.

### Infrastructure Service

**Infrastructure Service** includes **data backup**, **domain management**, **reverse proxy**, **shared GPU services**, and more.

In the **BEC architecture**, to give users the freedom of choice, all these services can be provided by either third parties or the users themselves.

**Terminus Space** is our ready-to-use solution for the **Terminus** world. We will also provide open-source, self-hosted solutions for these services. These allow users to create their own ecosystems without relying on any third-party.

### Host Service

Considering the need for resource flexibility, stability, and quick access, some organizations might want to deploy **Terminus** on public clouds.

The **Host Service** aims to simplify the process of setting up **Terminus** on these platforms.  **Terminus Space** follows best practices for cluster resource usage and security control. Compared to self-deployment, our approach can leverage the benefits of public clouds.

The **Host Service** is currently in an invite-only beta phase.
