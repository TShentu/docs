# Management Domain

Please [Creating a Domain](../../space/domain/host-domain.md) first. Then, you can **set up email invitation rules for organization members** and invite members to bind their own organization **Terminus Name** via email.

## Set Rule

Most companies use a standard domain suffix for their team members' emails, like A@myteam.com for person A or B@myteam.com for person B. But sometimes, team members might use emails in different domain, like A@gmail.com or B@myteam.com. So, we've set up two different rules for adding organization member emails:

- **Fixed Email Suffix**: In this case, you can enter your corporate domain suffix in the rule. Any emails that match the suffix requirement will then be able to bind as the organization's **Terminus Name**.

- **Specified Email Address**: If your organization doesn't have a corporate email suffix, you can use these rules. You just need to manually add the email address for each member of the organization.
:::info NOTE
We are sorry to inform you that, **ONLY Gmail or Google Workspace emails are supported** at the moment.
:::
:::info NOTE
Members and emails that have been bound to the **Terminus Name** will appear in the member list and cannot be deleted.
:::
:::info NOTE
Emails that are manually added and have not been bound to the **Terminus Name** will also be displayed in this list, shown as unbound status. Unbound emails can be deleted.

## Management Members

### Add Member

On the domain management detail page, you can manually add members to the organization by entering their email address.

After adding the member, please notify the user to use their email address to [bind as the organization's Terminus Name](../../termipass/account/index.md#organization-terminus-name).

### Remove Member

Unbound **Terminus Name** emails can be removed from the list. However, if a member has finished binding to the **organization's Terminus Name**, you won't be able to removed that.
