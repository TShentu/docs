# Tutorial

Welcome to the Terminus developer guides. These detailed tutorials offer a step-by-step guide on building a Terminus Application from scratch.

To get started, you can learn some basic concepts of Terminus, such as [What is Terminus](../../../overview/introduction/what-is-terminus.md), [Terminus Application Chart](../../develop/package/chart.md), [Terminus Extension on Helm](../package/extension.md). These fundamentals will help you grasp our development process more effectively.

You can also [learn about DevBox](devbox.md), a built-in app that Terminus provides for developers to build Terminus applications.

If you're brand new to Terminus development and want to jump straight into coding, start with the [**Create your first Terminus app**](./note/index.md). This tutorial will step you through the process of building a small note application.
