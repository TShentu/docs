# What is Terminus?

Terminus 的使命是“让人们再次拥有自己的数据”。

Terminus is a free, self-hosted operating system built on Kubernetes. It converts your edge device into a true home cloud, providing powerful cloud-level capabilities while maintaining ease of use and privacy. By securely storing your data and accessing your self-hosted services from anywhere via Terminus, you gain complete control over your digital life. 

Terminus is dedicated to advancing technological and AI equality by democratizing capabilities previously accessible only to large companies, making them available to every user.

Terminus consists of three core components and a series of protocols.

**核心组件**：

- [Snowinning Protocol](../../developer/contribute/snowinning/overview)，一个遵循了 W3C 标准，用户自主拥有，基于区块链智能合约的身份和信誉协议
- [Terminus OS](../terminus/overview.md)，一个运行在用户自己拥有的边缘设备上的基于 Kubernetes 改进的 source-available 的云原生操作系统
- [TermiPass](../../how-to/termipass/overview.md)，一个帮助用户管理链上身份和边缘设备的客户端软件

**协议**：

我们相信，在未来的去中心化的世界里，平台不再，而协议永存。除了 Snowinning Protocol 外，我们还提供了 3 个协议原型：

- [Otmoic Protocol](../protocol/otmoic.md)，一个基于 RFQ 和链上信誉，为公共物品提供价格，交换价值的协议
- [Market Protocol](../protocol/market.md)，一个无许可的应用分发协议，在新世界里，不再有苹果的审核和抽成
- [Recommend Protocol](../protocol/recommend.md)，一个去中心化和隐私保护的信息分发协议，期待将你从信息茧房中抽离出来

## Use Cases

- **Self-Hosted**: Terminus serves as a one-stop self-hosted solution where users can host and manage their data, operations, and digital life effectively, with full data ownership.

- **Local AI**: With the [AI Framework](../terminus/ai.md) provided by Terminus, users can host and run world-class open-source AI models locally, including large language models, image generation, and speech recognition. This allows the capability to create custom AI assistants that integrate seamlessly with personal data and applications, all while ensuring enhanced privacy and control.

- **Personal data repository**: Securely store, sync, and manage your photos, documents, and important files in a unified storage and access anywhere. 

- **Self-hosted workspace**: Create a free, powerful workspace for your team or family with open source selfhosted alternatives. 

- **Private media server**: Host your own streaming services with your personal media collections. 

- **Smart Home Hub**: Create a central control point for your IoT devices and home automation.  

- **User-owned decentralized social media**: Easily install decentralized social media apps such as Mastodon, Ghost, and WordPress on Terminus OS, allowing you to build a personal brand without the risk of being banned or paying platform commissions.
